# Foodbarrio ReactNative & GraphQL test

The goal is to implement a small Post/Comments app using GraphQL API and React Native.

## Screens

The app will have three screens.

- [x] **Login**
- [x] **List of posts**
- [x] **Create/Edit post**
- [x] **Post details**

### Navigation

- [X] The user inserts his/her username in the "Login" screen to enter the app. If the inserted username doesn't exists, it will be created.
- [X] After the login the user is moved to the "List of posts" screen where he/she can scroll the list of available posts (each post indicating when it has been created, the number of comments and the number of likes received).
- [X] From the "List of posts" screen the user can navigate back to the "Login" screen (logout) or to the "Post details" screen by tapping on one post.
- [X] In the "Post details" screen the user can scroll the list of available comments (each comment indicating when it has been created and the number of likes received).
- [X] From the "Post details" screen the user can navigate back to the "Login" screen (logout) or to the "List of posts" screen.

## Use cases
